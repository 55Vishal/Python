In order to do data analysis in Python, we should first tell you a little bit about the

1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,240
main packages relevant to analysis in Python.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,559
A Python library is a collection of functions and methods that allow you to perform lots

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,150
of actions without writing any code.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,220
The libraries usually contain built-in modules providing different functionalities, which

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,119
you can use directly.

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,349
And there are extensive libraries, offering a broad range of facilities.

7
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,960
We have divided the Python data analysis libraries into three groups: The first group is called

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,610
&quot;scientific computing libraries.&quot; Pandas offers data structure and tools for

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,820
effective data manipulation and analysis.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,040
It provides fast access to structured data.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,790
The primary instrument of Pandas is a two-dimensional table consisting of column and row labels,

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,100
which are called a DataFrame.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,210
It is designed to provide easy indexing functionality.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,539
The Numpy library uses arrays for its inputs and outputs.

15
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:03,380
It can be extended to objects for matrices, and with minor coding changes, developers

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,430
can perform fast array processing.

17
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,770
SciPy includes functions for some advanced math problems, as listed on this slide, as

18
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,980
well as data visualization.

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,790
Using data visualization methods is the best way to communicate with others, showing them

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,140
meaningful results of analysis.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,580
These libraries enable you to create graphs, charts and maps.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,420
The Matplotlib package is the most well-known library for data visualization.

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,190
It is great for making graphs and plots.

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,240
The graphs are also highly customizable.

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,720
Another high-level visualization library is Seaborn.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,300
It is based on Matplotlib.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,670
It&#39;s very easy to generate various plots such as heat maps, time series, and violin

28
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,460
plots.

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,680
With Machine Learning algorithms, we&#39;re able to develop a model using our dataset,

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,530
and obtain predictions.

31
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,130
The algorithmic libraries tackle some machine learning tasks from basic to complex.

32
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,190
Here we introduce two packages: The Scikit-learn library contains tools for

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,260
statistical modeling, including regression, classification, clustering and so on.

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,489
This library is built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

35
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,659
StatsModels is also a Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical

36
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,889
models, and perform statistical tests.
